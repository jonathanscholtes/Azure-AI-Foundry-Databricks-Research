# Azure AI Foundry Agent Development for Exploring and Reasoning over Databricks 

## Overview  

## üîß What You‚Äôll Build

- **Agentic AI with Azure AI Agent Service and Semantic Kernel**  
  Use prebuilt and custom agents to delegate tasks, make decisions, and interact with multiple endpoints - tools. Experiment with orchestration patterns using Semantic Kernel Agent Framework.

- **Integrations with OpenAPI and MCP**  
  Connect your agents to external services, such as Azure Databricks, to perform actions like retrieving live data, triggering workflows, or interacting with apps and systems ‚Äî leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) to define tools once and expose them consistently across scalable, modular architectures.
