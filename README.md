# Azure AI Foundry Agent Development for Exploring and Reasoning over Databricks 

## Overview  


- **Agentic AI with Azure AI Agent Service and Semantic Kernel**  
  Use prebuilt and custom agents to delegate tasks, make decisions, and interact with multiple endpoints - tools. Experiment with orchestration patterns using Semantic Kernel Agent Framework.

- **Integrations with OpenAPI and MCP**  
  Connect your agents to external services, such as Azure Databricks, to perform actions like retrieving live data, triggering workflows, or interacting with apps and systems ‚Äî leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) to define tools once and expose them consistently across scalable, modular architectures.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Steps**

Follow these key steps to successfully implement and deploy the workshop:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [**Setup and Solution Deployment**](docs/deployment.md)  
Step-by-step instructions to deploy **Azure AI Foundry** and all required services for the workshop environment, including:

- **Azure AI Foundry** components: AI Service, AI Hub, Projects, and Compute  
- **Azure Databricks** for agents to send spark queries via tool calling
- **Azure Storage Account** for document storage and data ingestion  
- **Azure Web App** to enable agent interactions via OpenAPI integrations
- **Azure Container Apps**  hosting of remote MCP server for agent dynamic tool calling
